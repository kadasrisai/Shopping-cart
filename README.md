Problem Statement:
The problem statement is to create a shopping cart simulation program. The program should allow users to:
1. Add products to the cart with their names, prices, and quantities.
2. Ensure that the quantity of items added to the cart is valid (greater than 0).
3. Apply discounts based on coupon codes ("SAVE10" and "50OFF").
4. Calculate the discounted total price.
5. Display the items in the cart and the final total price.
6. Handle exceptions (specifically, ValueError for invalid quantities) gracefully and provide error messages.
7. Regardless of exceptions, always display a "Thank you for shopping!" message.
